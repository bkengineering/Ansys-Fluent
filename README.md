Ansys Fluent is a computational fluid dynamics software. It produces accurate and reliable fluid simulation results. It is preferred over other CFD software for its advanced physics modeling capabilities, and fluid flow and heat transfer analysis. The software uses unique conservation equations for mass and momentum, besides additional equations for energy conservation.

The course covers all the features of Ansys essential for computational fluid dynamics, fluid simulation. Upon completion, you will be able to understand the staggered grid concept, which forms the basis for Fluent, and to master features like turbulence modeling and multiphase flow, and combustion models. The key modules of the course are:

- Study of Fluid Flows
- Introduction to CFD
- Learning CFD Equations and Numerical Solution
- Meshing
- Geometry Creation in ICEM CFD
- Turbulence Modeling
- Learn boundary and cell conditions
- Study solver mathematics and Post Processing
